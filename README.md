# LibraryManagementSystemCPP
This repository contains a C++ project for a library management system.
The system allows users to manage books, members, and borrowings. The project consists of several classes, including Book, Member, and Library, which are used to represent books, members, and the library respectively. The project also includes a books.txt file that stores book information in a comma-separated format.

The Book class provides functionality to create, display, and manage books, including adding books to the library, displaying all books, and checking book availability.

The Member class allows users to create and manage members, including adding members, displaying member information, and borrowing books.

The Library class serves as the main interface for managing books, members, and borrowings. It provides methods to add books and members, display book and member information, and manage book borrowings.

The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also includes error handling to handle cases where files cannot be opened, member IDs are not valid integers, and book availability is not "Available".

This repository serves as a template for building a library management system in C++, and can be extended or modified to suit specific project requirements. It provides a foundation for managing books, members, and borrowings in a library setting, and can be used as a starting point for further development and customization.
